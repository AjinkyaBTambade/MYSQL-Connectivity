# (1)Disconnected Architecture in C#

## Overview

In software development, a disconnected architecture refers to a design pattern where the application does not maintain a continuous connection to a data source, such as a database, throughout its execution. Instead, data is fetched from the source, manipulated or processed as needed, and then disconnected from the data source. This approach offers advantages in terms of performance, scalability, and offline capabilities.


## Components

### 1. Data Access Layer (DAL)

The DAL is responsible for interacting with the database or data source to fetch and manipulate data. In a disconnected architecture, the DAL typically retrieves data in a disconnected state, such as by using DataSets or DataReaders.

### 2. Business Logic Layer (BLL)

The BLL contains the business logic of the application. It receives data from the DAL, processes it, and prepares it for presentation to the user interface (UI). In a disconnected architecture, the BLL may work extensively with disconnected data objects to perform operations.

### 3. Presentation Layer (UI)

The UI layer is responsible for displaying data to the user and capturing user input. It interacts with the BLL to retrieve and manipulate data, but it does not directly communicate with the data source.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Design the Database Schema**: Define the structure of the database and tables that will store the application data.

2. **Create the Data Access Layer (DAL)**:
   - Implement methods to connect to the database and execute SQL queries or stored procedures.
   - Retrieve data using disconnected data objects like DataSets or DataReaders.
   - Close the database connection after data retrieval.

3. **Develop the Business Logic Layer (BLL)**:
   - Define classes and methods to implement the business rules and logic.
   - Receive data from the DAL, perform necessary operations, and prepare data for the UI.

4. **Implement the Presentation Layer (UI)**:
   - Design user interfaces to display data and capture user input.
   - Call methods from the BLL to retrieve and manipulate data.
   - Display results to the user and handle user interactions.

5. **Testing and Optimization**:
   - Test the application to ensure that data retrieval, manipulation, and presentation work as expected.
   - Optimize performance by minimizing the time and resources required for data operations.
   - Handle exceptions and errors gracefully.

  **Overall, disconnected architecture in C# provides a flexible and efficient approach to building robust applications that can handle various data processing scenarios while maintaining performance and scalability.**




# (2)Connected Architecture in C#

## Overview

In software development, a connected architecture refers to a design pattern where the application maintains a continuous connection to its data source, such as a database, throughout its execution. Data is fetched, processed, and updated directly within the connected environment. This approach offers advantages in terms of real-time data access, immediate updates, and transactional integrity.

## Components

### 1. Data Access Layer (DAL)

The DAL is responsible for interacting with the data source, such as a database server, to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. In a connected architecture, the DAL establishes and maintains connections to the database throughout the application's lifecycle.

### 2. Business Logic Layer (BLL)

The BLL contains the application's business logic and rules. It receives data from the DAL, processes it according to business requirements, and orchestrates transactions. In a connected architecture, the BLL often operates within the context of database transactions to ensure data integrity.

### 3. Presentation Layer (UI)

The UI layer is responsible for presenting data to users and capturing user input. It interacts with the BLL to retrieve data, trigger business logic operations, and update the UI based on user interactions. In a connected architecture, the UI may directly communicate with the database through the BLL to perform operations like data retrieval and updates.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Design the Database Schema**: Define the structure of the database and tables that will store the application data.

2. **Create the Data Access Layer (DAL)**:
   - Implement methods to establish connections to the database and execute SQL queries or stored procedures.
   - Perform CRUD operations within the connected environment.
   - Manage database connections, transactions, and error handling.

3. **Develop the Business Logic Layer (BLL)**:
   - Define classes and methods to encapsulate business rules and logic.
   - Receive data from the DAL, process it, and coordinate transactions.
   - Ensure transactional integrity by managing database transactions.

4. **Implement the Presentation Layer (UI)**:
   - Design user interfaces to display data and capture user input.
   - Call methods from the BLL to retrieve and manipulate data.
   - Handle user interactions and update the UI based on data changes.

5. **Testing and Optimization**:
   - Test the application to ensure that data access, business logic, and presentation layers work together seamlessly.
   - Optimize database queries and transactions for performance.
   - Conduct stress testing to evaluate the application's scalability and resilience under load.


**Connected architecture in C# provides real-time data access and immediate updates by maintaining continuous connections to the data source. By structuring applications with separate layers for data access, business logic, and presentation, developers can build scalable and maintainable solutions that meet the requirements of modern applications.**



# (3) Entity Framework Architecture in C#

## Overview

Entity Framework (EF) is an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that enables developers to work with relational databases using strongly-typed .NET objects. It simplifies data access by eliminating the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write. This README provides an overview of the architecture of Entity Framework in a C# application.

## Components

### 1. DbContext

The `DbContext` is the primary class that is responsible for interacting with the database. It represents a session with the database and provides APIs for querying and saving data. It also manages the mapping between domain objects and database tables.

### 2. DbSet

A `DbSet` represents a collection of entities of a specific type in the context of the database. It corresponds to a table or a view in the database. The `DbSet` class provides methods for querying and manipulating data.

### 3. Entity Classes

Entity classes are plain C# classes that represent entities in the domain model. Each entity class typically corresponds to a table in the database. Properties of entity classes map to columns in the database table.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Define Entity Classes**: Create plain C# classes to represent entities in the domain model. Decorate these classes with attributes to specify mappings to database tables and columns if needed.

2. **Create DbContext Class**: Implement a subclass of `DbContext` that represents the database context for your application. Define `DbSet` properties for each entity class to represent the tables in the database.

3. **Configure DbContext**: Override the `OnModelCreating` method of the `DbContext` class to configure the mappings between entity classes and database tables. Use Fluent API or data annotations for configuration.

4. **Use DbContext in Business Logic**: Inject an instance of the `DbContext` class into the business logic layer of your application. Use it to query and manipulate data in the database.

5. **Handle Data Access**: Use LINQ queries or methods provided by `DbSet` to query data from the database. Use methods like `Add`, `Update`, and `Remove` to manipulate data.


**Entity Framework provides a powerful and convenient way to work with databases in C# applications. By understanding its architecture and components, developers can efficiently build data-driven applications with minimal boilerplate code.**
